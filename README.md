# Luna Bella's Authentic Italian
I've been tasked with creating a website for Luna Bella's Authentic Italian restaurant. The client has requested that
the site has a simple but modern design. The site should provide descriptions of their most commonly ordered categories
of meals, show images of the primary members of the kitchen staff, explain that they have a wide selection of wines to
pair with their food and provide clear contact information. Most importantly, the site needs to provide a way to book
reservations and all "call-to-action" elements should direct the user to that end.

## Main Features
* Fully responsive site with hamburger navigation on mobile screens smaller than 600px
* Implement the ability to see information about their top 3 food categories and cycle through them using Javascript
* CSS transitions to enhance the feel of interactivity
